## Setups
* Python 3.6+
* Tensorflow 1.14.0
* Scikit-learn 0.21.3
* Numpy 1.17.2

## How to run model
### If you want to calculate relations of questions, you can do as below:
```
python3 prepare_relation.py
```
However, if you use the file of prepare_relation.py to generate relations of questions, you also need to modify code in pre_train.py where the original code load file of npz but prepare_relation.py will store relation matrix in txt format.
### If you want to pre-train question representations, you can do as below:
```
python3 pre_question.py
```
(Thanks to Mr.Sun for finding that we uploaded wrong loss function codes in pre_train.py, and we have updated the wrong component.)
### If you want to predict students' answer, you can do as below:
```
python3 main.py
```
